    <p> Here are some other HTML tags.</p> 
    <p> "h1" gives a big header, "h2" gives a smaller header, and so on. 
      Things enclosed by the tag "title" appear on the tab, so the tab name will not be just the URL. </p>
    <p> You will also notice that on this webpage, we used the "title" tag so that the name of the website isn't just a lengthy URL.</p>
