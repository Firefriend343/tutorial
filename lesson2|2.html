<p>Our next css lesson will be about colors. Lets's say that we wan't to change the color of specific text. In order to do so, first you must selct the text type by typing it out followed by a "{}". Then, inside of the curly braces, you write "color", followed by a colon. Then you can specify the color by saying red, or black, etc. You can also use hex codes for colors. Some common examples of hex codes, are #FF000(red) and #000000(black). Hex codes are always multiples of three. Another way of adding color is to use RGB. RGB stands for red, green, blue, and it gives a more exact notation to what color you want. To write an RGB, you write "color = rgb(number, number, number). The same concepts that you have learned so far can also be shown in background color, except it changes the background color and not the actual color of the element. Let's look at some examples!</p>

<p>This text isn't styled.</p>
<p id = "a">This text has a color of red.</p>
<p id = "b">This text has a color of #bf3434</p>
<p id = "c">This text has a color of rgb(255, 204, 233)</p>

<button>This button has a background color of red.</button>
