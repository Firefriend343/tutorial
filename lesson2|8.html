<p><b>In this lesson, we will be learning about the "hover" and "active" mechanics of css.<b></p>
<p>The first part is the hover mechanics. Basically, you go into your css, and type out the command you would like to style, as usual. Then, however, you put  colon and write the word hover, like this:
</p>
<p>command:hover {code}</p>
<p>This selects the command so that it can be styled when the mouse hovers over it. The code you can use then changes what you are styling, for example a button. You can o many things inside of the hover function, such as changing the pointer, or mouse, for cursor to pointer. You can also change the position using the top, left, bottom, and right style. </p>
