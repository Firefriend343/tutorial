<p>In the final lesson of our <b>Coding for kids tutorials</b>, we will be discussing a very comprehensive css topic: animations. Css animations have two main parts: "from" and "to". These represent the starting and ending stages of the animation.</p>
<p><b>from:</b> This represents the starting stage of what you want to animate, for example, a "div" tag with the id of container. First, you write "@keyframes", and under this code, you write what you want to syle, in this case #container. Then you write "from" followed by a {}, and inside the curly braces you tyype the starting look of the box. This could be something simple like background-red or something more complicated with multiple lines of code.</p>
<p><b>to:</b> This part represents what happens after the animation is finished. Thi could be something like "background color: red;" or "font-family: serif". One finished animation may look like this: </p>
<p>"@keyframes container {
  from {background-color: red;}
  to {background-color: yellow;}
}"</p>

<p>Once you have written your animation, you could style it further so that it is better. This happens directly under the element you want to style, such as in our example of #container. Here, you can put a few things, which we will be discussing briefly as to save time. The first is "animation-name", which in our example would have a value of container. Then there is animation-duration, which i how long you want an animation to last. After that is animation-delay, which tells how long you want the computer to wait before the animation works. In addition there is animation-iteration-count, which tells how many times you want the animation to run. There is also animation-direction, which deals with the direction of the animation if you want to move it. There is also the animation-timing-function, which tells of the speed curve of the animation. There are many more of these and you dont have to remember them all, but here is a handy website that can help out:</p>
