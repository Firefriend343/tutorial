	<p>In this lesson, we will be discussing <b>how to style fonts.</b></p>
	<p>There are two main fonts that are always stored in CSS, which are serif and sans-serif. 
	However, if you don't want to upload a font that is not already stored inside the code, 
	you go inside the head tag and before the style tag, copy the url of that font from google fonts.</p> 
	<p>To change the font inside of the CSS, you should type "font-family: whatever-font-you-chose;".</p> 
	<p>There are other ways of styling a font, such as using font-size and font-kerning. 
	Font-size changes the size of the font in pixels, written as px. 
	Font-kerning adjusts the space that there is between letter in a word.</p>
	<p>There are many other ways of styling fonts, and those are just the basics. 
	For more information on fonts, please check out this website: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font.asp.</p>
