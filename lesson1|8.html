  <p>In this lesson, we will be talking about two important html concepts, so please pay attention!</p>
  <p>The first concept is <b>buttons</b>. In order to create a button, you need to use the tag "button", 
    and everything inside of that button tag will be the text inside the button. 
    Another way to create a button is to use an "input" tag with the tag "submit". 
    To put text inside of this tag, you need to use a "label" tag.</p>
  <p>The second key concept is the use of <b>"a" tag</b>. 
    If you make an "a" tag and use "href" to reference it to a website, then clicking on whatever is inside of the "a" tag 
    will take you to that website.</p>
  <p>Here is an example of a button with an "a" tag:" </p>
  <p> "button""a href = "lesson1|10.html""Next Lesson"/a""/button" </p>
  <br>
  
  <a href = "lesson1|7.html"><button>Previous Lesson</button></a>  
  <a href = "lesson1|9.html"><button>Next Lesson</button></a>
  </body>
</html>
