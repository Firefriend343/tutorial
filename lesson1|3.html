  </head>
  <body>

    <p> Here are some other HTML tags.</p> 
    <p> "h1" gives a big header, "h2" gives a smaller header, and so on. 
      Things enclosed by the tag "title" appear on the tab, so the tab name will not be just the URL. </p>
    <p>You will also notice that on this webpage, we used the "title" tag so that the name of the website isn't just a lengthy URL.</p>
    <p>There are also tags like "head" and "/head", which are for the text headings. 
     You can use these for writing titles, just like the title at the top of the page! 
     There are few more HTML tags that we'll cover later in the review, but for now we'll proceed to the next lesson, 
      where you will review the basic script!</p>
