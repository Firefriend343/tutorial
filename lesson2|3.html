  <p>In this lesson, we will be discussing fonts. There are two main fonts that are usually always already stored inside of css, which are serif and sans-serif. However, if you wan't to upload a font that is not already stored inside of the code, you go inside of the head tag and before the style tag, and you copy the url of that font from google fonts. To do this, you go to Google Fonts, search the font, click on embed, and copy the code. Then, to change the font inside of the css, you call that element, and type "font-family: whatever-font-you-chose;". There are other ways of modifying font, such as font-size. This code changes the size of the font in pixels, written as px. Then their is font-kerning, which adjusts the space that their is between letter in a word. There are many other ways of styling fonts, nd those are just the basics. For more information on fonts, please check out this website: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font.asp.</p>
