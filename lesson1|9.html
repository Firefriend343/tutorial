  <p>In this lesson, we will be talking about two important html concepts, so plese pay attention! The first conspet is buttons. In order to create a button, you need to use a "button", and everything insdie of that button tag is text inside the button. Another way to create a button is to use an "input" tag with the type of "submit". to make text inside of this tag, you need to use a "label" tag. The second key concept we will be discussing is the "a" tag. If you make an "a" tag and use "href" to reference it to a website, clicking, on whatever is inside of the "a" tag will take you to that website.</p>

  <p>Here is an example of a button with and "a" tag:"

    <button><a href = "review2.html">Next page</a></button>
