  The first HTML tag we will use is "html". These tags are enclosed in <  or > signs in the code, but I won't use it here due to the fact the computer might think it is real code. This should enclose the entire program, so you should write all the code inside of these two tags. The beginning and end "html" tags are different, as the beginning one is just html with the < and > signs in between, while the end one is html with a </ in the front and a > at the end. Be sure not to confuse these up! For reference, it should look like this.
    Beginning: <tag>
    End: </tag>
