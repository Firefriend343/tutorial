This lesson is HTML tags.
Tags appear two times in your code if you use them. The first time they are enclosed around less than and greater than signs, and have the name of the tag inside of the signs. The second time they are the same, except they have a slash before the tag name, like "/html".
The first tag that should have all your other code inside of it is "html". These tags are usually surrounded by < and > signs, but here I will just use quotation marks.
Two other basic tags are the "head" and "body". The **body** tag usually has the most code inside of it, and the **head** tag usually has things like CSS styles inside of it.
Header HTML tags change the size of the text. Text is written inside of the **body** tag.
# This is the size of a **h1** tag, or the first size of a header.
## This is the size of a **h2** tag.
### This is the size of a **h3** tag.
Things can be written inside paragraphs using the "p" tag.
