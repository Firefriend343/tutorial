 <p>This lesson will be about creating scripts using basic tags. One basic tag is the "p" tag. When you place text inside of a "p" tag, it displays text on the screen in a very small size. The next tag is the "h1", tag written like that. It makes the text very big. There are also other tags that start with the letter h, from "h1" to "h6". As you get bigger numbers, the text gets smaller.</p>
