    <!---Dan please replace all the quotations with actual tags inside a <p> tag---->
    <p><b>Welcome to Coding for Kids Lesson 1!</b></p>
      <p>Today we will be learning about the most basic HTML tag that is the cornerstone of every HTML script.</p>
      <p>The first HTML tag we will use is "html". These tags are enclosed in <   > signs in the code, but I won't use 
        it here due to the fact the computer might think it is real code.
        <br>
        In this lesson and the following ones, I will use quotation marks instead. 
        This should enclose the entire program, so you should write all the code inside these two tags. 
        The beginning and end "html" tags are different, as the beginning one is just "html", 
        while the end one is written with a slash in the front "/html". 
        Be sure not to confuse these up!</p> 
    <p> For reference, it should look like this.</p>
    <p>Beginning: "html"</p>
    <p>End: "/html"</p>
    
    
    <p>Congratulations, you have completed the first lesson! If you want to go back to this lesson for future reference, just bookmark the site or write down the tags and thair uses.</p>
