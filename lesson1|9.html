   <p> In this lesson, we will be focusing a bit more on the "href" and "a" tag.</p> 
   <p> In the last lesson, we taught you that these can be used in buttons to send you to another website, 
    much like we have been using the buttons for. </p>
    <p> However, we can also use it for fonts, like the way we have done here. </p>
    <p> The real code looks like this: "link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=MedievalSharp&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"" </p>
    <p> However, this is more into the realm of CSS, which we'll be covering in the next unit. 
     But now, let's head to the review where you'll be answering questions! </p>
