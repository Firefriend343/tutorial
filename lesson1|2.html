  <body>
    <p> Some more HTML tags are "body" and "head". You can type text inside of the "body" tag and that will appear on the page, which is what I am doing now. Both of these tags should be inside of the "html" tag. </p>
    <p> Using HTML tags </p>
    <p> All of these HTML tags are used at least twice. There are others, which I will cover in the next page, but for now these are our focus. Both versions of the tag are surrounded by the < and > tags, but the ending one has a slash before the tag name. So a HTML tag called "p", which makes paragraphs, should look like this: </p>
    <p> (I will use quotation marks instead of < and > signs)  </p>
    <p>"p"This is random text. DEAL WTH IT!"/p" </p>
    <li><a href="lesson1|3.html"><button>Next</button></a></li>
