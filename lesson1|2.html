  <body>
    <p> Some more HTML tags are "body" and "head". You can type text inside of the "body" tag and that will appear on the page, 
      which is what I am doing now. Both of these tags should be inside the "html" tag. </p>
    <p><b> Using HTML tags </b></p>
    <p> All of these HTML tags are used at least twice. There are others, which I will cover in the next page, 
      but for now these are our focus. Both versions of the tag are surrounded by the < and > tags, 
      but the ending one has a slash before the tag name.</p>
    <p>So a HTML tag called "p", which makes paragraphs, should look like this: </p>
    <p> Note: I will use quotation marks instead of < and > signs  </p>
    <p>"p"This is random text."/p" </p>
