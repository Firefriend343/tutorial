	 <p>This lesson will be about creating scripts using basic tags.</p> 
	 <p>One basic tag is the "p" tag. When you place text inside of a "p" tag, 
		 it displays text on the screen in a new paragraph. 
		 The next tag is the "h1" which makes the text very big such as the header of a page. 
		 There are also other tags that start with the letter h, from "h1" to "h6". 
		 As the numbers go higher, the text gets smaller.</p>
