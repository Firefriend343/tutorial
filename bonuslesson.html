 <p>Now that you guys know the basic concepts of html, it is time to start you with a bonus lesson. This lesson will be about four tags that don't serve any purpose in your html itself, but that will make it very easier to style things in css. The first to tags are "id"'s and "classes". Id's are tags that you put inside of a tag itself, like "p id = "yee"". Just like it sounds, these give a direct indentification to the tags, so that you can directly style them in css. Then there are "class" tags, which follow the same concept as "id" tags, except that no two tags can have the same id, but they can have the same class. Then we have "div" tags and "span" tags. "div" tags are big containers in which you can store your data. This makes it easier to style large pieces of data rather than all of them individually. Once again, "span" tags follow the same logic, but they only work for text inside of a tag, unlike "div"'s.</p>

 <p>We hope you learned a lot from our lessons, and we'll catch you next time folks!</p>
