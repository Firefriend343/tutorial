    <p> In this lesson, we will be focusing a bit more on the "href" and "a" tag. In the last lesson, we taught you that these can be used in buttons to send you to another website, much like we have been using the buttons for. </p>
    <p> However, we can also use it for fonts, like the way we have done here. </p>
    <p> The real code looks like this: "link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=MedievalSharp&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"" </p>
    <p> However, this is more into the realm of CSS, which we'll be covering in the next unit. But now, let's head to the review where you'll be answering questions! </p>
