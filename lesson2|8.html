<p><b>In this lesson, we will be learning about the "hover" and "active" mechanics of css.<b></p>
<p>The first part is the hover mechanics. Basically, you go into your css, and type out the command you would like to style, as usual. Then, however, you put  colon and write the word hover, like this:
</p>
<p>command:hover {code}</p>
<p>This selects the command so that it can be styled when the mouse hovers over it. The code you can use then changes what you are styling, for example a button. You can do many things inside of the hover function, such as changing the pointer, or mouse, for cursor to pointer. You can also change the position using the top, left, bottom, and right style. Another thing you can change is background, from white to red, or #fc3 to #000. There are many thhing you can do with the css hover function, and more on it is found right here:</p>

  <p>The active selector is similar to the hover selector, except that everything under it is run when something is clicked on. For more info, check out this website:</p>
