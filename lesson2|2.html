	<p>Our next css lesson will be about <b>Colors.</b></p>
	<p>Lets's say that we want to change the color of a specific text. 
	In order to do so, first you must selct the text type by typing it out followed by a "{}". 
	Then, inside of the curly braces, you write "color", followed by a colon. 
	Then you can specify the color by saying red, green, blue, or black, etc.</p> 
	<p>You can also use hex codes for colors. Some common examples of hex codes, are #FF000(red) and #000000(black). 
	Hex codes are always multiples of three.</p>
	<p>Another way of adding color is to use RGB. RGB stands for red, green, blue, and it gives a more exact notation to 
		what color you want. To write an RGB, you write "color = rgb(number, number, number).</p> 
	<p>The same concepts that you have learned so far can also be shown in background color, 
		except it changes the background color and not the actual color of the element.</p> 
	<p>Let's look at some examples!</p>

<p>This text isn't styled.</p>
<p id = "a">This text has a color of red.</p>
<p id = "b">This text has a color of #bf3434</p>
<p id = "c">This text has a color of rgb(0,128,0)</p>

<button id = "d">This button has a background color of red.</button>
