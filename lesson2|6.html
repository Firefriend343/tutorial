<p>In this lesson, we will learn about borders and styling links. For borders, you can select what you wan't to put a border around,  for example a "div" tag, an write border:, followed by three things. The first thhing is how you wan't the border to look like. This means whether you wan't it to be solid, dashed, etc. Then, you write how thick you wan't the border to be, such as 1px, 2px, 1rem, 2rem, etc. Finally, you write what color you wan't the border to be. This means blakc, white, #fc3, etc. A finished border may look like this: "border: solid 1px #000;". By the way, all css comands need to end in a ";". The second concept we will be discussing is styling links. We all know from our html lessons that links are made from "a" tags which reference you to nother website, but you can actually syle the link in many ways. On way is to select the link and write "text-decoration: none;". This gets rid of all of the underline and other decoration that is on the link by default. You could also use text-transform, which could make it all uppercase and all lowercase, their are many ways of syling link and other text, so for more information, use this website: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp</p>

<p id = "a">This text has a border of solid 1px #000</p>
<p id = "b">This text has a border of dashed 2px red</p>
<p id = "c"><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6EoRBvdVPQ">This link takes you to a random website, but is not underlined.</a></p>
<p id = "d"><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6EoRBvdVPQ">This link takes you to a random website, but is all caps.</a></p>
