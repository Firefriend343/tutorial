  <p><b>Welcome to Coding for Kids Lesson 2!</b></p>
  <p>The first CSS lesson is how to put things in a "style" tag.</p>
  <p>For CSS, you type the tag that you want to style, for example "p", and you put curly braces. 
    Then you can add designs like padding, margin,etc.
  This is what text looks like without being style with padding and margin:  </p>
  <p class = "yee"> Sample Text </p>
  <p>And this is what it looks like with padding and margin:</p>
  <p id = "yee"><span> Sample Text </span></p>
  <p>See the difference?</p>
